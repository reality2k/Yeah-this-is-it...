		<p> ADHD meds make it easier to do tasks.
			but, they don't necessarily make you do tasks that actually fit into a larger purpose or goal... you still have to focus on the goal. I guess one of the tasks that it can help you do is to sit down & make your plans & break it down into smaller steps (little tasks) to achieve the goal. like anything, ADHD meds aren't the be-all end-all. just a tool in a toolbox of many other tools. </p>

			Here’s some career ideas for you: </p>
			<p>

				restocking the shelves in the library</p>

			<p>
				doing medical research studies</p>

			<p>
				buying collectibles and then selling them. You’ll need a truck or a van you’ll need a storage locker. You’ll need maybe get a space in a consignment shop.</p>

			<p>
				Buy a house that’s attached to a commercial properties so you can write off your mortgage. Payments is tax-free.</p>

		<p> boomers wilin out on fb. I'm writing this through dictation directly into the Neocitirs terminal. h ha ha, this is just a trend! I'm really scared. I'm scared and I'm feeling lonely. I feel like I wanna cry. I don't know if I'm looking forward to anything. I wanna own a house. I want my girlfriend's mental health to improve. I want her to be OK. I want her to be happy. I want her to understand the world. All my friends? Mo most of them are kind of weird… The world feels so petty and small. Petty. That's the only word I can think to describe it. "It is a tail told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing." Just like Macbeth said ha ha.

		<p> Israel is a joke. its the most ridiculously fascist regime i have ever seen or can rven can conceive of occurring in this current world. if you support it, i know you would have been one of the Germans who supported the 3rd Reichstag.

			No - I dont need to lesrn more or understand anything further. there is this ridiculous notion that nuance is always gold. no. sometimes, the truth is so obvious, that to deny it is tantamount to sin. </p>
